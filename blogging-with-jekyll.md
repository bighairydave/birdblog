What is Jekyll? Why would I want to use it? Answers to this sort of question can be found on this page.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a program that takes the things you write, along with pictures and whatnot, and turns them into a set of files that you can upload to a webhost to make a website. There are many of these programs out there, but Jekyll is probably the most popular. In particular, programmers and web designers like to use Jekyll for their personal blogs.

Jekyll's official website is [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Why use Jekyll instead of Wordpress, Blogger, or similar?

There are many blogging services out there that are great for blogging. I use Wordpress for some purposes myself. However, there are a few reasons why I like Jekyll and think it's particularly suitable for the sort of projects described here:

### Pros

* I like to have my stuff on my computer rather than trusting somebody else with it.
* future proof
* etc this is really a work in progress!

### Cons

* It's really nerdy - you need to be a bit computer-savvy and comfortable with fiddling about to make use of it.
* If you want to write blog posts on the go or from different computers there's even more setting up required - although some people enjoy that sort of thing.
