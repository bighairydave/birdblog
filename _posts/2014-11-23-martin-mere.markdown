 Bird fair day at Martin Mere and it was a good day for seeing the birds as well as poking around the stalls looking at books and optical instrumentation.

 The highlight was a Tawny Owl roosting in a tree near the Kingfisher hide. Pochard, Raven, Grey Wagtail and Marsh Harrier were also noteworthy, as well as a glimpse of a Fieldfare behind the duckery that will go down as a life tick even though it wasn't really a satisfying view.

 The guided tour with Graham Clarkson was entertaining and edifying in equal measure.
