Owls on three consecutive days! I popped in to Marshside for a quickie on my way home from business in town, and lo and behold there was a barn owl hunting in the area between Rainford's Lagoon and Marshside Road.

Liz Gent captured [this smashing shot](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=758924837489857) of the bird flying back to the cover of the taller vegetation with dinner in hand.
