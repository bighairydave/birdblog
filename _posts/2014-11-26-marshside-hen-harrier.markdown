I'm rolling a couple of days into one here.

On about the 24th I was just leaving Sandgrounder's after an uneventful little spell - I think I'd been at Marshside to look at Godwits but there weren't any - when I caught a brief view of a male Hen harrier quartering the saltmarsh. Not a great view, to be fair, but better than nothing.

On the 26th, I basically staked out the area for the whole day, but the Hen harrier only showed whilst I was in Nel's Hide to warm up. Such is life.

However, other birds were seen!

In the Crossens direction were a Great White egret - smashing views of that - and a difficult raptor perched on a post that I shall decline to hazard a guess at.

A Ross's Goose was present in front of Sandgrounder's, and a female Pochard on Rainford's lagoon. Reed buntings were present in the car park.

During my time in Nel's I saw the rest of the birds listed: nothing unusual there!
